\par                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
\par 
\par  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
\par Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
\par of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
\par 
\par 
\par This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
\par the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
\par License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
\par 
\par 0. Additional Definitions.
\par 
\par As used herein, ""this License"" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License, and the ""GNU GPL"" refers to version 3 of the GNU
\par General Public License.
\par 
\par ""The Library"" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
\par other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
\par 
\par An ""Application"" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
\par by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
\par Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
\par of using an interface provided by the Library.
\par 
\par A ""Combined Work"" is a work produced by combining or linking an
\par Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
\par with which the Combined Work was made is also called the ""Linked
\par Version"".
\par 
\par The ""Minimal Corresponding Source"" for a Combined Work means the
\par Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
\par for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
\par based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
\par 
\par The ""Corresponding Application Code"" for a Combined Work means the
\par object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
\par and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
\par Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
\par 
\par 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
\par 
\par You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
\par without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
\par 
\par 2. Conveying Modified Versions.
\par 
\par If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
\par facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
\par that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
\par facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
\par version:
\par 
\par  a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
\par  ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
\par  function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
\par  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
\par 
\par  b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
\par  this License applicable to that copy.
\par 
\par 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
\par 
\par The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
\par a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
\par code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
\par material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
\par layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
\par (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
\par 
\par  a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
\par  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
\par  covered by this License.
\par 
\par  b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
\par  document.
\par 
\par 4. Combined Works.
\par 
\par You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
\par taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
\par portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
\par engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
\par the following:
\par 
\par     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
\par     the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
\par     covered by this License.
\par 
\par     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
\par     document.
\par 
\par     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
\par     execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
\par     these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
\par     copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
\par 
\par     d) Do one of the following:
\par 
\par         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
\par         License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
\par         suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
\par         recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
\par         the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
\par         manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
\par         Corresponding Source.
\par 
\par         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
\par         Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
\par         a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
\par         system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
\par         of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
\par         Version.
\par 
\par      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
\par      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
\par      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
\par      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
\par      Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
\par      Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
\par      you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
\par      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
\par      Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
\par      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
\par      for conveying Corresponding Source.)
\par 
\par 5. Combined Libraries.
\par 
\par You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
\par Library side by side in a single library together with other library
\par facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
\par License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
\par choice, if you do both of the following:
\par 
\par     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
\par     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
\par     conveyed under the terms of this License.
\par 
\par     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
\par     is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
\par     accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
\par 
\par 6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
\par 
\par The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
\par of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
\par versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
\par differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
\par 
\par Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
\par Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
\par of the GNU Lesser General Public License ""or any later version""
\par applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
\par conditions either of that published version or of any later version
\par published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
\par received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
\par General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
\par 
\par If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
\par whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
\par apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
\par permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
\par Library.

\par SQLite Copyright
\par 
\par SQLite is in the Public Domain
\par 
\par All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors.
\par All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits
\par dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits
\par are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish,
\par use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a
\par compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.
\par 
\par The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite - those parts of the SQLite
\par library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Portions of the
\par documentation and some code used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses.
\par The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and
\par build code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite
\par library.
\par 
\par All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken
\par from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its
\par original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the
\par SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

\par use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
\par only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by
\par their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which
\par such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
\par (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
\par Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
\par infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
\par terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
\par 
\par 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
\par thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
\par that You meet the following conditions:
\par 
\par    1. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
\par    License; and
\par 
\par    2. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
\par    the files; and
\par 
\par    3. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
\par    copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
\par    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
\par 
\par    4. If the Work includes a ""NOTICE"" text file as part of its distribution, then any
\par    Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
\par    notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
\par    any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
\par    text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
\par    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
\par    by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
\par    contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
\par    License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
\par    distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
\par    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
\par 
\par You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
\par different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
\par modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction,
\par and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
\par 
\par 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
\par intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
\par terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
\par Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate
\par license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
\par 
\par 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
\par service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
\par customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE
\par file.
\par 
\par 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
\par provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an ""AS IS"" BASIS,
\par WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
\par limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
\par FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
\par appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your
\par exercise of permissions under this License.
\par 
\par 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
\par negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and
\par grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for
\par damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
\par character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
\par (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
\par malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
\par been advised of the possibility of such damages.
\par 
\par 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative
\par Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
\par indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
\par in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
\par responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
\par defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted
\par against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
\par liability.
