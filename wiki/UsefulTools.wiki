==[http://code.google.com/p/metageta/source/browse/tools/batchuploadmef.py Batch Upload MEF]==
This script can be used to batch upload MEF (Metadata Exchange Format) files to GeoNetwork. It works around some of the [http://trac.osgeo.org/geonetwork/ticket/169 issues] in the GAST (import actions and error handling) and Web interface (local files only) batch upload functions. It requires the poster library - http://atlee.ca/software/poster (not included here). For users not experienced in installing python modules: 1. download and unzip the tar.gz. and 2. copy/move the poster folder to your python installation director - C:\PythonX\Lib\site_packages.

==[http://code.google.com/p/metageta/source/browse/tools/geonetwork-service GeoNetwork Windows Service]==
This script can be used to set up GeoNetwork as a Windows Service while still using the default Jetty servlet engine, rather than running under a Tomcat service.  It does not use the Windows Resource Kit "srvany.exe" as that doesn't gracefully shutdown GeoNetwork when stopping the service.  It requires Python 2.5-2.7 and PyWin32.
