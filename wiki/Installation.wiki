= System =
Runs on Windows XP or Vista (only tested on 32 bit OS). 

It has also been tested and mostly runs on 64 bit Linux (Ubuntu 9.04). 
However, there are issues with segfaults and read errors on HDF and NetCDF files on Ubuntu <=9.10. This is a GDAL/HDF4/NetCDF incompatibility - the UbuntuGIS gdal packages are built against a HDF4 library (libhdf4g) which includes an implementation of the netcdf api that is incompatible with the NetCDF library. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/HDF for more info. The only way around it (currently) is to build your own HDF4 library from source and then link to that when building gdal from source. This should not be a problem on current versions of Debian or Ubuntu > 10.04 (lucid lynx) where gdal is/will be built against the new libhdf4-alt library

= Installation =
*Windows*:

Download the package containing OSGeo4W from the [http://code.google.com/p/metageta/downloads/list downloads] area and extract to a local directory.  It will run from a network path, but is considerably slower.  The application contains all the 3rd party libraries and applications required. The MrSID and ECW drivers use proprietary SDK's. See mrsid-eula.txt and ecw-eula.txt in the `<install>\OSGeo4W` directory.


*Linux* (or Windows where you wish to use your own Python and GDAL/OGR installations):

[http://code.google.com/p/metageta/downloads/list Download] the package that doesn't contain OSGeo4W, extract somewhere and see below:

You will need the following libraries:

  * Python 2.5 or 2.6 and the following non-standard Python libraries: (if you wish to use Python 3.0+, you will need to port the application)
    * epydoc http://epydoc.sourceforge.net
    * 4Suite XML http://4suite.org
    * xlutils (inc. xlrd & xlwt) http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlutils
    * pywin32 http://pywin32.sourceforge.net (obviously only on Windows)
    * GDAL python bindings (see below)

  * GDAL 1.6+ http://www.gdal.org
    * On Windows, use OSGeo4W to get GDAL 1.6 and the appropriate python bindings http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w (Don't use FWTools, it only supports python 2.3.)
    * On ubuntu, try the UbuntuGIS packages https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS (or build from source if you prefer)
    * If you want to read ECW/JPEG2000/MrSID files, you'll need to install and link to the appropriate SDK (if building from source) or the OSGeo4W plugins (http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/pkg-gdal-mrsid & http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/pkg-gdal-ecw) or the see the UbuntuGIS scripts - gdal-mrsid-build gdal-ecw-build (located in /usr/bin by default if installed from the repos) and see - http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/ubuntu/2009-June/000054.html and http://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/wiki/TutorialMrSid
    * You will also have to download and build appropriate libraries for other non-standard GDAL formats. 
    * See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints for more info
