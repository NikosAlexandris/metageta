#summary How to install MetaGeta.
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= System =
Runs on Windows XP or Vista (only tested on 32 bit OS). 

It has also been tested and mostly runs on 64 bit Linux (Ubuntu 9.04). 
However, there are issues with segfaults and read errors on HDF and NetCDF files on Ubuntu <=9.10. This is a GDAL/HDF4/NetCDF incompatibility - the UbuntuGIS gdal packages are built against a HDF4 library (libhdf4g) which includes an implementation of the netcdf api that is incompatible with the NetCDF library. See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/HDF for more info. The only way around it (currently) is to build your own HDF4 library from source and then link to that when building gdal from source. This should not be a problem on current versions of Debian or Ubuntu > 10.04 (lucid lynx) where gdal is/will be built against the new libhdf4-alt library

= Installation =
*Windows*:

[http://code.google.com/p/metageta/downloads/list Download] the setup zipfile and extract and run the installer.  The application contains all the 3rd party libraries and applications required. The MrSID, JPEG2000 and ECW drivers use proprietary SDK's, to add support for these formats, download the plugins setup zipfile and extract and run the installer. 


*Linux (or Windows where you wish to use your own Python and GDAL/OGR installations)*:

[http://code.google.com/p/metageta/downloads/list Download] the source package or [http://code.google.com/p/metageta/source/checkout checkout] a copy of the source code, extract somewhere and see below:

You will need the following libraries:

  * Python 2.5 or 2.6 and the following non-standard Python libraries: (if you wish to use Python 3.0+, you will need to port the application)
    * [http://epydoc.sourceforge.net epydoc]
    * [XML http://4suite.org4Suite]
    * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlutils xlutils] 1.41+
    * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd xlrd] 0.71+
    * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt xlwt] 0.72+
    * [http://pywin32.sourceforge.net pywin32] (obviously only on Windows)
    * GDAL python bindings (see below)

  * GDAL 1.6+ http://www.gdal.org
    * On Windows, use [http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w OSGeo4W] or the prebuilt binaries at [http://vbkto.dyndns.org/sdk] to get GDAL 1.6+ and the appropriate python bindings (Don't use FWTools, it only supports python 2.3.)
    * On Ubuntu, try the [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS UbuntuGIS] packages (or build from source if you prefer)
    * If you want to read ECW/JPEG2000/MrSID files, you'll need to install and link to the appropriate SDK (if building from source) or the OSGeo4W plugins [http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/pkg-gdal-mrsid gdal-mrsid] & [http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/wiki/pkg-gdal-ecw gdal-ecw]) or the see the UbuntuGIS scripts - gdal-mrsid-build gdal-ecw-build (located in /usr/bin by default if installed from the repos) and see - http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/ubuntu/2009-June/000054.html and http://trac.osgeo.org/ubuntugis/wiki/TutorialMrSid
    * You will also have to download and build appropriate libraries for other non-standard GDAL formats. 
    * See http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildHints for more info
