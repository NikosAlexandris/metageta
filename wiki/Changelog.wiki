#summary Changelog for releases

17/05.2010
MetaGETA 1.3.1 released

Bugfix
* This fixes a serious bug in the installer (Issue 27)  that would prevent the crawler from running if the PC didn't already have python installed.

Enhancements
* Enhanced the check that tests whether a dataset has been updated (Issue 26)
* Renabled the reading of ERS files associated with ECW datasets to extract extra metadata. This was originally disabled when MetaGETA used GDAL 1.6x and NCS_*.dll ECW redistributables as GDAL would segfault on certain ERS/ECW files. GDAL 1.7 with libecwj2.dll appears to be much more stable.
* Updated README.txt
